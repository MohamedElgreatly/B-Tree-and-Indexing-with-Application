1- Overview
   In this assignment, youâ€™re required to implement a B-tree and a simple search engine application that utilizes the B-Tree for data indexing.
2- Introduction
2.1  B-Tree
   B-trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disks or other direct access secondary storage devices. Unlike the red-black trees, B-tree nodes can store multiple keys and have many children. If an internal B-tree node x contains x.n keys, then x has x.n + 1 children. The keys in node x serve as dividing points separating the range of keys handled by x into x.n + 1 sub-ranges, each handled by one child of x.
2.2 Simple Search Engine
    will be given a set of Wikipedia documents in the XML format and you are required to implement a simple search engine that given a search query of one or multiple words you should return the matched documents and order them based on the frequency of the query words in each wiki document, please check the requirements section for more details.

3 Requirements

3.1 B-Tree
   You are required to implement a generic B-Tree where each node stores key-value pairs and maintains the properties of the B-Trees. The following interfaces should be implemented:

3.2 Simple Search Engine
You will be given a set of Wikipedia documents in the XML format (you can download the Wikipedia data sample from here), and you are required to parse them (using Java DOM XML parser is recommended) and maintain an index of these documents content using the B-Tree to be able to search them efficiently. The following interface should be implemented:
